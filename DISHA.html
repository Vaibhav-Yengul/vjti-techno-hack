<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<br />
Worldwide more than 44 million people are suffering from Dementia and in 60-80% of cases cause of Dementia is Alzheimer's disease. 
58% of the people suffering from dementia live in developing countries where they do not have access to smartphones and even if they have 
they do not have access to high speed internet connection.<br />The major problems faced by people suffering from Dementia is their loss of
navigational capabilities due to loss of memory and can easily get confused with lane numbers and forget their way back home.

<h2>Solution</h2>
<br />
We created Disha wristband for people suffering from Dementia and diseases like Alzheimer to help them navigate back to home when they forget their path.
The wristband consists of an on-board GPS receiver which would constantly acquire the geographical co-ordinates of the user.
If the user crosses a geo-fence (pre-defined by the user's family), a warning SMS notification is transmitted to the phone
of the user's family members 
and the location of the user is then displayed onto a real-time tracker (accessible both through a website as well as on an Android app) that can help 
the family members in tracking down the user in real-time.
The wristband also consists of a Panic button which can be pressed by the user to manually notify 
their family that they lost their path (even if the user is within the geo-fence) and also trigger a notification onto the smartphone of the user's family 
members about his/her present co-ordinates and help the family members in tracking the user and locating him/her.
The wristband is designed in a way such that 
the User Interface is smooth and easy to use. It also gives haptic and auditory feedback to the user to help them while navigating way back home. We also 
have an Android app to help visualize the location of the user on a map and track them in real-time.
